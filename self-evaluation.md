## Self-Evaluation

1. I think I'm fine with what I've learned about arrays so far. There are many methods and I know a few, however I also know how to research them and learn about new ones.

2. I understand that it is best practice to use only one data type.  I am wondering when we use methods like .to_s or .to_proc, for example.  However I don't think its necessary for me to understand that before moving on.

3. Aside from methods, are there any other objects in Ruby that communicate with arrays?  Do we write code that work with arrays specifically?  Are there other ways of storing data aside from arrays?
